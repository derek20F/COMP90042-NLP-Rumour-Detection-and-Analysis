# COMP90042-NLP-Rumour-Detection-and-Analysis

In this project, I implemented a natural language processing model, the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, to automatically detect rumour tweets on Twitter. My model successfully detected the rumour tweets with an 83% F1-Score. Also, I performed sentiment, topic, hashtag, and user information analyses on Covid-19 related rumour to explore its special pattern.
